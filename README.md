# Simple Python Projects 🐍

A collection of my beginner-level Python scripts built while learning the language.

## ☕ 1. Coffee Menu Program

## 💼 2. Job Offer Evaluator
**File:** `judge&say.py`  
Helps evaluate if a job offer is worth taking based on:  
- Salary  
- Working hours  
- Remote option

Outputs one of three results:
- `take it, queen! 👑`
- `think twice, princess...`
- `run. now.`

## 💻 3. Computer Log Tracker
**File:** `computer.py`  
A program that tracks login/logout events for multiple machines using:
- Classes & Objects (`Event` class)
- Dictionary manipulation  
- Sorting by event time  

It generates a report showing which users are currently logged in on each machine.
